I hope you enjoy my Starfleet Themed Sales Tracker. Tricky project dealing with nullable data types and should have created the SalesRep name as a single entity instead of first name and last name.
I greatly enjoyed the challenge of the class and really had to think on how to accoomplish some of these tasks. Thanks for the great semester!
